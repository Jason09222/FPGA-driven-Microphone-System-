In this project, you will be designing a custom microphone system using a multiprocessor 
system on a chip (an MPSoC) system that has an FPGA and ARM microprocessor (assume 
you are a start-up company who wants to develop custom audio hardware and 
applications). Your product involves capturing user audio (as a personal recording device) 
via a microphone and then processing the audio using the MPSoC.  
There are two parts/tasks to the project with the first task being to develop a basic 
microphone system and the second task extending the basic design based on each team’s 
choice of extension. The basic microphone system will include an I2S MEMS microphone 
breakout board interfaced with the FPGA. The FPGA module of the system will drive the 
microphone, collect the audio samples from the microphone, and send the audio samples to 
the software running on the ARM processor. As an example, the software for the basic 
system can be a simple audio recorder that records and save the collected audio samples 
into a wav file that can be played back using a media player or into a csv file that can 
opened with an application such as MATLAB to display the waveform or playback. 
The second task will be a more open-ended system extension task where teams can decide 
what features to add to their microphone system. See the deliverables and talk to your tutors 
for what options can you extend on.
